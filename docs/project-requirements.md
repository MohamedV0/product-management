## Project Overview
This is a JavaScript application that implements a complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) product management system with advanced filtering, sorting, and validation capabilities.

## Core Requirements
1. Create a web application that allows users to manage product information
2. Implement functionality to add, display, update, and delete products
3. Include comprehensive form validation
4. Implement filtering and sorting capabilities
5. Provide a responsive, user-friendly interface

## Technical Guidelines
### Core Functionality
- Create input fields for product information (Name, Price, Category, Description, Image)
- Implement "Add product" button to save new products
- Display saved products in a card layout
- Include "Edit" button to update existing products
- Include "Delete" button to remove products
- Implement form validation with proper error messages
- Support filtering by search term and category
- Support sorting by various criteria (date, name, price)
- Persist data in localStorage

- Proper event handling and delegation
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- Error handling and user feedback

## Notes
- Focus on clean code implementation
- Ensure smooth user experience
- Support image upload and preview
